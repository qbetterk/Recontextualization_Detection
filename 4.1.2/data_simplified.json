Since then, the war has shown no sign of abating with both Ukrainian and Russian troops claiming victories in various parts of the country. While Ukrainian troops were largely successful in keeping Kremlin\u2019s soldiers from urban parts of the country, parts of rural Ukraine saw Russian troops occupying their homes and offices, often leaving behind mass graves with hundreds of corpses bearing signs of torture. Russia now holds 20% of Ukraine Russian forces now control around 20% of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Thursday. This includes the 7% of Ukraine that was already in Russian hands following the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Kremlin\u2019s pursuance of inconsistent occupational measures in parts of southern Ukraine that it captured suggests \u201cindecision\u201d on Russia\u2019s part as to how to integrate occupied territory, concluded the report. Here\u2019s a look at how the war progressed so far: Initial deflection The days preceding the invasion were fraught with tension \u2014 for days, Russia and its friendly neighbour Belarus had announced joint military exercises and dismissed Western concerns of a possible invasion.

In the information vortex that followed the invasion, Zelenskyy took to Twitter and Instagram videos from landmark sites in Kyiv to assure Ukrainians that he has not left the country and that he is working with the world leaders to rally support in the form of sanctions on Russia, financial aid to Ukraine, and arms and ammunition for its fighters. two days after the invasion and sought India\u2019s \u201cpolitical support\u201d at the UNSC.

Since then, the war has shown no sign of abating with both Ukrainian and Russian troops claiming victories in various parts of the country. While Ukrainian troops were largely successful in keeping Kremlin\u2019s soldiers from urban parts of the country, parts of rural Ukraine saw Russian troops occupying their homes and offices, often leaving behind mass graves with hundreds of corpses bearing signs of torture. Russia now holds 20% of Ukraine Russian forces now control around 20% of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Thursday. This includes the 7% of Ukraine that was already in Russian hands following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. As per an AP estimate, this amounts to an additional 58,000 square kilometres under Russian control, a total area slightly larger than Croatia. X X LIVE An error occurred.

He was near Severodonetsk, a city in Ukraine\u2019s east that in recent weeks, the French and Ukrainian foreign ministries said in separate statements. Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who visited Kyiv on Monday, wrote on Twitter that Leclerc-Imhoff had been killed \u201cby a Russian bombardment of a humanitarian mission while he was carrying out his duty to inform. \u201cI have spoken with the government of Luhansk and asked President [Volodymyr] Zelensky for an inquiry, and they assured me of their help and support,\u201d she wrote. BFM said its journalist had been hit by shrapnel from the bombing, and his colleague Maxime Brandstaetter was wounded. Their local fixer Oksana Leuta was not hurt. \u201cThis tragic event reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been risking their lives to describe this conflict for more than three months now,\u201d BFM said in a statement.

The village in the Swiss Alps has been transformed into a glitzy venue for the four-day confab ostensibly dedicated to making the world a better place. The event is resuming in person after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also delayed this year's meeting from its usual winter slot because of uncertainty over the omicron variant. For the attendees, there's much to tackle amid soaring food and fuel prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change , inequality and persistent health crises. But it's hard to predict if the high-minded discussions will yield substantial announcements that make headway on the world's most pressing challenges. The elite attendees have filled the conference venue, to both schmooze and listen to panel discussions on topics like the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change and the global economic outlook. Attendees also are visiting nearby pavilions on Davos' main drag set up by companies like Intel, Accenture and Facebook owner Meta. Besides Zelenskyy's speech, there's also a sizable Ukrainian government delegation attending in person, making their case for more Western support in the country's fight against Russia. Russian officials have not been invited to Davos this year, with what was dubbed the \"Russia House\" having been transformed by critics - including Ukrainian tycoon Victor Pinchuk and the country's Foreign Ministry - into what they call the \"Russia War Crimes House.\" The venue features photos of crimes and cruelties that Russian forces are accused of perpetuating. Some victims will speak out - including Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, a town near Kyiv where killings of civilians drew outrage. While Ukraine will capture attention on the meeting's first day, climate and environmental issues will be a constant theme as the forum looks to future challenges as much as the current ones.

    "content": "DAVOS: A virtual keynote speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be a focus of the first day of the World Economic Forum gathering of corporate executives, government officials and other VIPs that kicked off Monday in Davos , Switzerland. The village in the Swiss Alps has been transformed into a glitzy venue for the four-day confab ostensibly dedicated to making the world a better place. The event is resuming in person after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also delayed this year's meeting from its usual winter slot because of uncertainty over the omicron variant. For the attendees, there's much to tackle amid soaring food and fuel prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change , inequality and persistent health crises. But it's hard to predict if the high-minded discussions will yield substantial announcements that make headway on the world's most pressing challenges. The elite attendees have filled the conference venue, to both schmooze and listen to panel discussions on topics like the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change and the global economic outlook. Attendees also are visiting nearby pavilions on Davos' main drag set up by companies like Intel, Accenture and Facebook owner Meta. Besides Zelenskyy's speech, there's also a sizable Ukrainian government delegation attending in person, making their case for more Western support in the country's fight against Russia. Russian officials have not been invited to Davos this year, with what was dubbed the \"Russia House\" having been transformed by critics - including Ukrainian tycoon Victor Pinchuk and the country's Foreign Ministry - into what they call the \"Russia War Crimes House.\" The venue features photos of crimes and cruelties that Russian forces are accused of perpetuating. Some victims will speak out - including Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, a town near Kyiv where killings of civilians drew outrage. While Ukraine will capture attention on the meeting's first day, climate and environmental issues will be a constant theme as the forum looks to future challenges as much as the current ones. One-third of the roughly 270 panel discussions through Thursday's finale will focus on climate change or its effects, with extreme weather, efforts to reach \"net zero\" emissions and finding new, cleaner sources of energy on the agenda.",

    "title": "Explosions rock Ukraine's capital Kyiv, battle rages on in east",
    "content": "KYIV: Kyiv was rocked by several explosions early on Sunday, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said, a day after officials said its troops had recaptured a swath of the eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk in a counter-offensive against Russia \"Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,\" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \"Services are already working on site.\" A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. At least one person was hospitalised but no deaths had been reported as of early Sunday, Klitschko said. Other officials said the Russian bombardment appeared to be targeting the railway network. Despite continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine and the widespread destruction, Kyiv has been relatively calm in recent weeks after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south, especially an intense battle for Sievierodonetsk. Russia has concentrated its forces on the factory city for one of the biggest ground battles of the war, with Moscow appearing to bet its campaign on capturing one of the two eastern provinces it claims on behalf of separatist proxies. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region that includes Sievierodonetsk, said on Sunday Ukrainian forces controlled about half the city after recapturing a large chunk from Russian troops. \"It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,\" Gaidai said on Ukraine's television. \"The city is now, more or less, divided in half.\" The claims could not be independently verified. Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian counter-attacks there over the past 24 hours were likely to blunt any operational momentum that Russian forces had previously gained. Moscow said its own forces were making gains in the city. Ukraine's army said Russian forces continued to mount assault operations with the aid of artillery and controlled the eastern part of Sievierodonetsk. \"The situation is tense, complicated,\" Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk told national television on Saturday, saying there was a shortage of food, fuel and medicine. \"Our military is doing everything it can to drive the enemy out of the city.\" Both sides claim to have inflicted huge casualties in the fighting, a battle that military experts say could determine which side has the momentum for a prolonged war of attrition in coming months. Ukrainian officials said at least eight people were killed and 11 injured in Russian shelling in the neighbouring Donetsk region. Donetsk and Luhansk make up the wider Donbas region where Russia hopes to take control. 'NO POINT' IN NEGOTIATIONS In the diplomatic sphere, Kyiv rebuked French President Emmanuel Macron for saying it was important not to \"humiliate\" Moscow. \"We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means,\" Macron said in an interview published on Saturday, adding he was \"convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power.\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted in response: \"Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. \"Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy offered a stark message: \"The terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment... if one person in Moscow simply gives the order,\" he said, in an apparent reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin . \"The fact that there is still no such order is obviously a humiliation for the whole world.\" Putin will discuss the war in an interview due to be broadcast on national television on Sunday. In a brief excerpt aired on Saturday he said Russian antiaircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are \"cracking them like nuts\". Ukraine says it aims to push Russian forces back as far as possible on the battlefield, counting on advanced missile systems pledged in recent days by the United States and Britain to swing the war in its favour. Asked about Macron's mediation offer on national television, Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said there was \"no point in holding negotiations\" until Ukraine received all the pledged weapons, strengthened its position and pushed Russian forces \"back as far as possible to the borders of Ukraine\". Moscow has said the Western weapons will pour \"fuel on the fire\" but will not change the course of what it calls a \"special military operation\" to disarm Ukraine and rid it of nationalists. In the war, marked its 100th day on Friday, tens of thousands are believed to have died, millions have been uprooted from their homes, and the global economy has been disrupted. Ukraine is one of the world's leading sources of grain and cooking oil, but those supplies were largely cut off by Russia's closure of its Black Sea ports, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos.",

'NO POINT' IN NEGOTIATIONS In the diplomatic sphere, Kyiv rebuked French President Emmanuel Macron for saying it was important not to \"humiliate\" Moscow. \"We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means,\" Macron said in an interview published on Saturday, adding he was \"convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power.\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted in response: \"Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. \"Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy offered a stark message: \"The terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment... if one person in Moscow simply gives the order,\" he said, in an apparent reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin . \"The fact that there is still no such order is obviously a humiliation for the whole world.\" Putin will discuss the war in an interview due to be broadcast on national television on Sunday. In a brief excerpt aired on Saturday he said Russian antiaircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are \"cracking them like nuts\". Ukraine says it aims to push Russian forces back as far as possible on the battlefield, counting on advanced missile systems pledged in recent days by the United States and Britain to swing the war in its favour. Asked about Macron's mediation offer on national television, Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said there was \"no point in holding negotiations\" until Ukraine received all the pledged weapons, strengthened its position and pushed Russian forces \"back as far as possible to the borders of Ukraine\". Moscow has said the Western weapons will pour \"fuel on the fire\" but will not change the course of what it calls a \"special military operation\" to disarm Ukraine and rid it of nationalists. In the war, marked its 100th day on Friday, tens of thousands are believed to have died, millions have been uprooted from their homes, and the global economy has been disrupted. Ukraine is one of the world's leading sources of grain and cooking oil, but those supplies were largely cut off by Russia's closure of its Black Sea ports, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos.",

    "content": "KYIV: Kyiv was rocked by several explosions early on Sunday, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said, a day after officials said its troops had recaptured a swath of the eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk in a counter-offensive against Russia \"Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,\" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \"Services are already working on site.\" A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. At least one person was hospitalised but no deaths had been reported as of early Sunday, Klitschko said. Other officials said the Russian bombardment appeared to be targeting the railway network. Despite continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine and the widespread destruction, Kyiv has been relatively calm in recent weeks after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south, especially an intense battle for Sievierodonetsk. Russia has concentrated its forces on the factory city for one of the biggest ground battles of the war, with Moscow appearing to bet its campaign on capturing one of the two eastern provinces it claims on behalf of separatist proxies. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region that includes Sievierodonetsk, said on Sunday Ukrainian forces controlled about half the city after recapturing a large chunk from Russian troops. \"It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,\" Gaidai said on Ukraine's television. \"The city is now, more or less, divided in half.\" The claims could not be independently verified. Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian counter-attacks there over the past 24 hours were likely to blunt any operational momentum that Russian forces had previously gained. Moscow said its own forces were making gains in the city. Ukraine's army said Russian forces continued to mount assault operations with the aid of artillery and controlled the eastern part of Sievierodonetsk. \"The situation is tense, complicated,\" Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk told national television on Saturday, saying there was a shortage of food, fuel and medicine. \"Our military is doing everything it can to drive the enemy out of the city.\" Both sides claim to have inflicted huge casualties in the fighting, a battle that military experts say could determine which side has the momentum for a prolonged war of attrition in coming months.
